                 <p>India ranks joint 68th out of 113 countries in the 2022 edition of the  GFSI. Within the Asia-Pacific region, it ranks 14th out of 23 countries.  Its performance across all the index’s four pillars is generally  consistent, but its score on the availability pillar—62.3—is its  highest. The country’s weakest performance is in the Sustainability  and Adaptation pillar, for which it scores 51.2. India’s performance  suggests that the food security environment in the country is  particularly under threat from climate-change risks. The country  needs to better manage these negative impacts on its food security  by focusing on improving political commitment to adaptation; managing eutrophication in its oceans, rivers and lakes; and  addressing the risks associated with the quality and quantity of water  available for agriculture. </p>

                <p>India’s performance on the index has generally improved over the years. Yet focus is required to ensure that improvements are consistent across pillars.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>India’s scores under Availability and Quality and Safety experienced 
minor improvements (+5.8 and +8.7), and a larger increase of 11.6 
points was observed in the Sustainability and Adaptation pillar. 
However, India’s performance on the Affordability pillar has weakened 
since 2011—the country has experienced a score decrease of 3.2 points. 
The drop in this pillar can be ascribed to a fall of 26.8 in (1.5) Food 
safety-net programmes, which is due to a sharp decline in funding for 
these programmes in 2020 that has continued through to 2022. Given 
that a large proportion of Indians live below the poverty line, such 
programmes are critical to overall food security.</p> <hr />
             <p>The large improvement in Sustainability and Adaptation can be 
attributed to score increases in (4.6) Disaster risk management (+43.3) 
and (4.5) Political commitment to adaptation (+24.6). India is still in 
the moderate score bracket for political commitment to adaptation. 
Improving this is key to addressing adaptation and sustainability risks, 
itself essential to improving overall food security in the country. </p>

                    <p>India demonstrates strength in building policies to ensure that its population has access to food, and that nutritional standards of food are high. Increasingly, the country

                   score for this indicator highlights increasing commitment to managing disaster

                   overall on this indicator, scoring 100 points each year since 2013. The existence 
                   of an agency and policy for food security highlights the importance attributed
