          text={'Storage and cold-storage facilities are crucial in preventing and reducing post-harvest losses in agriculture. These facilities provide a controlled environment that slows down the deterioration of perishable crops, fruits, and vegetables, extending their shelf life. By maintaining proper temperature, humidity, and ventilation conditions, they inhibit the growth of pathogens and reduce enzymatic activities that lead to spoilage. This preservation helps farmers store their produce until market conditions are favorable, reducing wastage and ensuring a consistent supply of fresh products.'+
