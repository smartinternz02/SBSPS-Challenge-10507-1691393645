            This depends on various factors such as socioeconomic conditions, geographical conditions, crop variety, and irrigation facilities, etc. The role of technology in agriculture can have various applications by way of use of modern farming machines, improved seed varieties, application of fertilizer/ pesticides, genetic engineering, etc. This will result in increased productivity by preventing soil degradation, using water efficiently, and reducing the use of chemicals. These factors will create a direct benefit in enhanced quality, quantity, and cost reduction.

            With indiscriminate use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, this endemic problem plagues agriculture. The goal to enhance the productive potential of soil through emphasis on its physics and micro-biology will include the design of chemical interventions (macro and micronutrients). Particular emphasis is needed in arid areas.

          <div class="card_text1">
            <p>
            The agriculture sector is the largest consumer of water in India. But limited water availability leads to increasing competition between industry, domestic use, and agriculture. An immediate need is to plan and manage water in river basins to achieve a synergy in consumption on a multi-sectoral basis. This calls for augmenting supply through rainwater harvesting, recharging aquifers, and renovation of existing wells and ponds. Demand management should receive priority through improved irrigation practices, including sprinkler and drip irrigation. This will require a water literacy movement and regulation for the use of groundwater to achieve a conjunctive use of rain, river, ground, sea, and treated sewage water.</p>

            Reform in this area is key to enhancing small farm productivity. Easy and affordable credit must be made available through official channels for farmers that typically rely on private moneylenders. Risk mitigation by way of crop insurance requires immediate reform. The speed and the mechanism of this process requires policymakers to create innovative solutions that balance the financial system with farmers’ needs.</p>            <hr />

            The importance of opportunities for assured and remunerative sale of produce will ultimately determine the economic well-being and sustainability of the farming sector. Market reform is a corollary of demand and supply and must be linked to production planning and not merely with government-led support interventions. The link between consumption and commerce chains is key to long-term survival and growth of the farming community. </p>            <hr />

            The modern agricultural business is evolving in a variety of directions at the same time. However, its primary focus is utilizing agricultural technologies to boost crop yields through better planning and smarter management. By promoting more efficient and sustainable farming methods, advanced technology in agriculture helps farmers prosper in today’s agribusiness. Time-tested practices like crop rotation and new agricultural technologies, such as monitoring field productivity with machinery and satellite images or special farming software, all contribute to the viability of agriculture.</p>            <hr />

          <div class="card_text1">
            <p>
            Agricultural technology aims to make work in the field more efficient and convenient. Each year, there are various new agricultural innovations and, occasionally, ground-breaking technologies. As agribusiness continues to modernize and grow, it is becoming increasingly crucial for agricultural consultants, food producers, and technology managers to be knowledgeable and up-to-date with the latest technological standards.

           Water, fertilizer, pesticides, and other inputs are no longer applied “by eye” or uniformly across the field by large agricultural producers. The use of advanced agriculture technologies allows for the precise application of only what is required in each location, as well as the careful tailoring of treatment for each plant.</p>            <hr />

            <p>
            Precision or smart farming, also called Agriculture 3.0, evolved out of the need to track and more efficiently manage all inputs into crop production. The pursuit of precision agriculture and its associated agricultural technology has led to the development of new farming methods and tools.</p><hr />
            <p>The Global Positioning Satellite System (GPS) was the breakthrough technology that made this age of farming possible. GPS helps find deviations within a given agricultural production space, allowing for more effective use of available resources. This was the main reason why the idea of sustainable agriculture and a number of automation options came about.</p>

          <div class="card_text1">
            <p>
            Agriculture technology 5.0, or simply put, “digital agriculture,” refers to the next generation of farming methods and tools for maximizing crop yields and other agricultural outcomes. One such technology is 5G, which is currently undergoing rapid development and will improve the reach and accessibility of the latest agritech achievements around the world.</p><hr />
            <p>Compared to prior farming methods, digital agriculture technology excels in the following aspects:</p>
            <p>data collection efficiency: how much data can be collected in a given amount of time or space;</p>
            <p>data accuracy: how close a measurement is to the truth;</p>
            <p>timeliness: how quickly the data can be processed into practical information and reported to end users.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>When it comes to weather, pests, and diseases, agricultural producers have little to no control. Yet, with the advent of digital technologies in agriculture, they may lessen the negative influence of these elements. Meanwhile, digital agricultural technologies give farmers the opportunity to greatly increase the efficiency of decision-making and the return on factors that they directly control. Some examples are:</p>
            <p>what types of crops to grow;how to rotate crops for the best results, when and how much water to use for precision irrigation, when, how much, and what kind of nutrients and plant protection products to apply,what kind of tillage works best with a given type of soil.</p>
